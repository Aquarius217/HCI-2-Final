<h2>Medicinal plants For Anti-Malaria </h2>
<p>Malaria is one of the world’s most important parasitic disease and a leading cause of death especially in developing countries. It is endemic in about 100 developing countries, leading to about 1.2 million estimated deaths each year in Africa, with pregnant women and children below 5 years being mostly affected. A wide range of medicinal plants is employed for the treatment of malaria, since majority of the people who get infected cannot afford the existing expensive orthodox medicines. The problem of resistance to existing antimalarial agents by parasite has necessitated the search for new and potent agents, and the focus of researchers is on natural products especially medicinal plants since active compounds like quinine and artemisinin were isolated from plants and have been lead compounds for antimalarial drug development. Various medicinal plants have been investigated for their anti-malarial activity and some with demonstrated potent in vitro activity have been reviewed below. </p>



<p>Terminalia ivorensis

T. ivorensis A. Chev. belongs to the family Combretaceae and is commonly known as ‘black afara’ and by the Asantes as ‘amire.’ It is a large deciduous forest tree of 15–46 m high, normally grown as timber plantation in many tropical countries. In traditional medicine, various parts of the plant is used to treat malaria, yellow fever, pile, stomach ulcer, wounds and other infection.</p>
 
<p> Elaeis guineensis

E. guineensis Jacq (Arecaceae), popularly known as oil palm is a monocotyledonous plant which belongs to the coccoid group of palms. It grows up to 15 m high with a lifetime of over 100 years and occurs throughout the tropical rainforest belt of West Africa. E. guineensis is commonly used for treating gonorrhea, rheumatism, headache, wounds. An in vitro anti-plasmodial assay revealed that, the ethanolic extract of E. guineensis leaves has potent antimalarial activity with IC50 of 1.195 μg/mL, against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum.</p>

<p>Casearia sylvestris

C. sylvestris var. lingua (Cambess.) Eichler, (Salicaceae) is an evergreen shrub or small tree with long, slender branches and a very dense globose crown. Usually 4–6 m tall, but can grow up to 20 m high, with wide distribution throughout South America. It has been employed in traditional medicine for treating snake bites, wounds, inflammation, fevers, gastric ulcers and diarrhea.</p>

p>Cupania vernalis
C. vernalis Cambess. (Sapindaceae) is a semi-deciduous tree with elongated and dense crown, which can grow up to 10–22 m tall. It can be found in almost all forest formations in Brazil, South America, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia. The tree serves as source of tannins and wood locally, and in traditional medicine as diuretic, stimulant, expectorant, natural surfactant, sedative and for treating stomach-ache and dermatitis. </p>
