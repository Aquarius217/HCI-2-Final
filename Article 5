<h2>Natural Remedies for High Cholesterol</h2>

<p>Natural or complementary treatments for heart disease often aim to control cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and improve heart health. Typically, research on such treatments is limited, compared with that of conventional medical treatments.

Few natural products have had enough research done to prove they can reduce cholesterol clinically. However, many people have experienced some success with alternative treatments, and some cholesterol-lowering supplements and natural remedies might be helpful.</p>

<p> Astragalus
Astragalus is an herb used to support the immune system in traditional Chinese medicine. It has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It’s considered to be an “adaptogen.” This means it’s believed to protect the body against various stresses.

Limited studies suggest that astragalus may have some benefits for your heart. But according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), high quality clinical human trials are generally lackingTrusted Source. More research is needed to learn how astragalus may affect your cholesterol levels and overall heart health.</p>

<p> Hawthorn
Hawthorn is a shrub related to the rose. Its berries, leaves, and flowers have been used for heart problems since the Roman Empire.

Some studies have found the plant to be an effective treatment for milder forms of heart failure. However, research results are conflictingTrusted Source, warns the NCCIH. There’s not enough scientific evidence to know if hawthorn is effective for other heart problems.

Also, hawthorn can have negative interactions with many prescription medications and other herbs.</p>

<p> Flax seed
Flax seed comes from the flax plant. Both flax seed and flaxseed oil contain high levels of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). This is an omega-3 fatty acid that may help lower your risk of heart disease.

Research on the benefits of flaxseed for heart health has produced mixed resultsTrusted Source, reports the NCCIH. Some studies suggest that flaxseed preparations may help lower cholesterol, particularly among people with high cholesterol levels and postmenopausal women.</p>
